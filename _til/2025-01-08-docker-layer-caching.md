Today I learned about optimizing Docker builds using layer caching effectively. Here are the key points:

1. Order matters: Put infrequently changing commands at the top
2. Combine related commands in single RUN
3. Use .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files
4. COPY requirements first, then rest of the code

Example:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Copy requirements first
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Then copy the rest
COPY . .
```
